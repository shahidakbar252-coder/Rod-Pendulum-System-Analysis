# Rod-Pendulum-System-Analysis
Simulates a multi-body mechanical system consisting of a rod and two pendulums. Features include symbolic derivation of the Lagrangian using SymPy, numerical integration of equations of motion via SciPy to observe chaotic behavior, and energy conservation analysis with trajectory visualizations.
